### Unix
First you will need [devkitArm] which can be obtained with

```bash
wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/files/Automated%20Installer/devkitARMupdate.pl
chmod +x devkitARMupdate.pl
sudo ./devkitARMupdate.pl /opt/devkitPro
echo "export DEVKITPRO=/opt/devkitPro" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export DEVKITARM=\$DEVKITPRO/devkitARM" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export PATH=\$PATH:\$DEVKITARM/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Please note: The env variables need to be available from sudo

```bash
Defaults env_keep += "DEVKITPRO DEVKITARM"
```

The following can be installed with [3ds_portlibs]:
* libpng 1.6.19
* libJPEGTurbo 1.5.1
* freetype 2.7.1

The following will need to be manually installed:
* [sf2dlib]
* [sftdlib]
* [sfillib]

When cloning the repo make sure to use `git clone --recursive` in order to also get buildtools and the other dependencies.

In case you're compiling for *hax-based homebrew launchers ensure you also create an xml file with 
`<targets selectable="true"></targets>` and put it along side the `.3dsx` file with matching names.

### Windows
Install the following using [devkitProUpdater]:
* [devkitArm] r46
* [libctru] 1.2.1
* [citro3D] (commit 3ae31ad)

**Note**: It is suggested to install dev tools at the root of your disk drive i.e. `C:\Development\devkitPro`

Once installed, make sure you have access to a C compiler from `cmd`. If you're not sure install [mingw-w64] to 
`C:\Development\mingw-w64` and then add the path `C:\Development\mingw-w64\mingw32\bin` to your env variables.

Open command prompt as an **administrator** and `cd` into the devkitPro installation folder. Some commands need admin 
rights to properly install. Additionally make sure your antivirus software does not interfere. 

Next `git clone` the latest [3ds_portlibs]:
* zlib
* libpng 1.6.19
* libJPEGTurbo 1.5.1
* freetype 2.7.1

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devkitPro/3ds_portlibs.git
cd 3ds_portlibs

make zlib
make install-zlib

make libpng
make install libpng

make libjpeg-turbo
make install libjpeg-turbo

make freetype
make install freetype
```

Manually install each of the following into the devkitPro folder:
* [sf2dlib]
* [sftdlib]
* [sfillib]

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xerpi/sf2dlib.git
cd sf2dlib/libsf2d
make
make install

git clone https://github.com/xerpi/sftdlib.git
cd sftdlib/libsftd
make
make install

git clone https://github.com/xerpi/sfillib.git
cd sfillib
make
make install
```

Finally, clone this repo recursively and build with

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/BernardoGiordano/PKSM.git
cd PKSM
make
make install
```

In case you're compiling for *hax-based homebrew launchers ensure you also create an xml file with 
`<targets selectable="true"></targets>` and put it along side the `.3dsx` file with matching names.
